"""
-Prompts the user for a level, n.
    -If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.
-Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = ,
wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with digits.
-No need to support operations other than addition (+).
-Prompts the user to solve each of those problems.
    -If an answer is not correct (or not even a number)
        -the program should output EEE and prompt the user again,
    If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries
        -the program should output the correct answer.
The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.
